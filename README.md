PizzaRat is a Discord bot that will help you get around NYC using the world's most famous transit system!

## Commands
  * `t/time <line> <station>` - Returns the arrival times for the next three trains in both directions
    * `t/time L Bedford Av`
  * `t/line <line>` - Returns all stations on a line
    * `t/line G`

## Notes
This is a rewrite of [my first version of PizzaRat.](https://github.com/aaronpagoada/pizza-rat.js) I initially made it using JavaScript but I kept running into this problem that I spent about too long trying to crack. Decided to use Python and it has been good since.
