# PizzaRat
PizzaRat is a Discord bot that will help you get around NYC using the world's most famous transit system!

## Commands
  * `t/time`
  * `t/line`

## Notes
This is effectively a rewrite of [my first version of PizzaRat.](https://github.com/aaronpagoada/pizza-rat.js) I initially made it using JavaScript but I kept running into this problem that I spent about two years trying to crack. As you can probably deduce, I decided I wasn't going to keep trying to fix it. Instead, I was going to use Python to make the bot.

As of this commit, I can confidently say that Python is signifcantly smoother and perhaps even a bit more fun.
